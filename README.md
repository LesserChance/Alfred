Alfred: shared mind mapping experiment
==============================================

* Author: Ryan Bateman

Description
-----------

This project was built to learn node.js, now.js, require.js, canvas and various other libraries.  Theres a really simple server which keeps js state in tact between multiple clients.

Various keys are mapped to both modules and actions.

You can create objects/run actions on the canvas by holding down keys as defined in the map file and clicking.

It's been mostly abandoned. Though i'd like to pick it back up.
